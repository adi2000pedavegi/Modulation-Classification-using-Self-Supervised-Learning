cnn_matlab_selftraining

Self-training process is implemented for a written deep learning matlab code

Source of matlab code : https://in.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/modulation-classification-with-deep-learning.html

supervisedlearning.mlx file implements supervised learning using CNN

selfsupervised.mlx file implements self training process where CNN is used as supervised classifier 

Percentage of unlabelled training samples are varied as 5,15,25,35 and 50%

Performance of SNR vs Accuracy are recorded in idpplot.m file for both supervised learning and self-training process at various percent of unlabelled training samples
